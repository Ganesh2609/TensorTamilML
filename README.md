## Learning Philosophy

Tensor Tamil follows a **clarity-first, depth-oriented philosophy**:

✓ **Strong Fundamentals** — Build concepts that scale to advanced topics
✓ **Intuition → Theory → Code** — Every topic follows a structured learning path
✓ **No Blind Abstractions** — Internal workings are explained before using libraries
✓ **Engineering Mindset** — Learn how and *why* systems are designed
✓ **Readable, Educational Code** — Code is written for understanding, not shortcuts
