# Machine Learning Full Series in Tamil — Code Repository

A complete Machine Learning course in Tamil, covering every major ML concept from intuition to theory to coding. This repository contains all code implementations accompanying the **[Tensor Tamil YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@TensorTamil)**.

## About Tensor Tamil

**TensorTamil** is a dedicated learning space for anyone who wants to understand Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning clearly and deeply. Each video breaks down complex ideas into simple, intuitive explanations using visual tools, real-world intuition, and step-by-step code implementations.

- **Channel**: https://www.youtube.com/@TensorTamil
- **Focus**: Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and AI fundamentals
- **Teaching Style**: Intuition → Mathematics → Code Implementation
- **Language**: Tamil with English technical terms

### Channel Philosophy

Whether you are a beginner exploring core concepts or an engineering student strengthening your foundations, this channel guides you through each topic in a clear, structured, and practical way.

Lessons include:
- Graphical intuition using visual tools (GeoGebra, diagrams)
- Detailed mathematical derivations of key equations
- Loss functions, gradients, and optimization methods
- Multiple coding approaches—from scratch implementations to clean functional versions
- Real-life dataset applications

## Course Philosophy

This course is built for learners who want clarity without shortcuts:

✓ **Build Strong Fundamentals** — Understand the "why" behind each concept, not just the "how"
✓ **From Intuition to Code** — Progress logically from visual understanding → mathematical theory → implementation
✓ **No Black-Box Learning** — Every algorithm is explained and coded from scratch first
✓ **Clear, Readable Code** — Code prioritizes learning over performance
